---

### ⚠️ Design Decisions - PENDING

Critical decisions still needed:

#### 1. **GUI Architecture Pattern** ❗ URGENT

**Decision Needed:** MVP (Model-View-Presenter) vs MVC (Model-View-Controller)?

**Options:**
- **MVP** (Recommended for wxWidgets)
  - ✅ Better testability (Presenter can be unit tested)
  - ✅ Cleaner separation (View is passive)
  - ✅ Works well with wxWidgets event system
  - ❌ More boilerplate

- **MVC** (Traditional)
  - ✅ Well-known pattern
  - ✅ Less code
  - ❌ View-Controller coupling
  - ❌ Harder to test

**Recommendation:** **MVP** - Better for large, testable desktop app

**Impact:** Affects all GUI code structure
**Required By:** Phase 0 Week 2 (wxWidgets integration)

---

#### 2. **Undo/Redo System** ❗ URGENT

**Decision Needed:** Command pattern implementation details

**Questions:**
- Command stack size limit? (memory)
- Granularity: per-character? per-word? per-operation?
- Persistence: save undo stack to .klh file?
- Multi-document: shared or separate stacks?

**Recommendation:**
- Stack size: 100 commands (configurable)
- Granularity: per-operation (typing session, formatting change)
- Persistence: No (fresh start on load)
- Multi-document: Separate stacks

**Impact:** Affects Document model implementation
**Required By:** Phase 1 Week 9-10 (Editor integration)

---

#### 3. **Threading Model Details** ❗ MODERATE

**Decision Needed:** Worker thread pool configuration

**Questions:**
- How many worker threads? (for auto-save, plugin operations)
- Thread pool or spawn-on-demand?
- Python GIL handling strategy?

**Recommendation:**
- 2-4 worker threads (CPU-bound operations)
- Thread pool (std::thread pool or wxThread pool)
- Python GIL: Use pybind11 py::gil_scoped_release for long operations

**Impact:** Plugin performance, auto-save smoothness
**Required By:** Phase 0 Week 5-6 (Plugin Manager)

---

#### 4. **Document Model - Memory Strategy** ❗ MODERATE

**Decision Needed:** How to handle large documents (100k+ words)?

**Options:**
- **Load all in memory** (simple, fast, memory-hungry)
- **Lazy loading chapters** (complex, memory-efficient)
- **Hybrid** (load visible + recent, unload old)

**Recommendation:**
- **MVP (Phase 1):** Load all in memory (simpler)
- **Phase 3+:** Add lazy loading if users report issues
- **Threshold:** If document > 500k words, warn user

**Impact:** Memory usage, performance
**Required By:** Phase 1 Week 8 (Document model)

---

## 🎯 Dependency Analysis

### What Blocks What?

```
Phase 0 Foundation
├── Week 1-2: CMake + wxWidgets
│   └── DEPENDS ON: Nothing (can start now!)
│
├── Week 3-4: Python embedding
│   └── DEPENDS ON: Nothing (pybind11 well-documented)
│
├── Week 5-6: Plugin Manager
│   └── ❌ BLOCKED BY: 04_plugin_system.md (Extension Points spec)
│   └── ❌ BLOCKED BY: 03_architecture.md (Event system)
│
└── Week 7-8: Event Bus + Document model
    └── ❌ BLOCKED BY: 03_architecture.md (patterns, threading)

Phase 1 Core Editor
├── Week 9-10: wxRichTextCtrl
│   └── ❌ BLOCKED BY: 03_architecture.md (MVP pattern, undo/redo)
│
└── Week 11+: All editor features
    └── ❌ BLOCKED BY: Week 9-10 completion
```

**Critical Path:**
1. Complete 03_architecture.md
2. Complete 04_plugin_system.md
3. Then can proceed with Phase 0 Week 5+

**Partial Start Possible:**
- ✅ Can start Phase 0 Week 1-4 NOW
- ⏸️ Must pause at Week 5 until docs complete

---

## 📚 Cross-Document Consistency

### ✅ Consistent Decisions

All documents agree on:
- C++20 + wxWidgets 3.2+ (tech stack)
- Plugin architecture from day zero
- pybind11 for C++/Python binding
- .kplugin format (ZIP containers)
- MIT License (core) + proprietary (premium plugins)
- All 3 platforms from MVP
- 18-month timeline
- Semantic Versioning

**No conflicts found!** 🎯

---

### ⚠️ Minor Inconsistencies

#### 1. **README.md vs actual doc status**

README.md says:
```
| 03 | Architecture | ✅ Complete |
| 04 | Plugin System | ✅ Complete |
| 07 | MVP Tasks | ✅ Complete |
```

**Reality:** All three are placeholders (📝 Draft)

**Fix:** Update README.md status indicators

---

#### 2. **CLAUDE.md outdated TODO**

CLAUDE.md says:
```
[ ] **WAITING:** bwx_sdk i18n pattern (user input needed)
```

**Reality:** 09_i18n.md is complete (1,086 lines, based on bwx_sdk)

**Fix:** Mark as complete in CLAUDE.md

---

#### 3. **11_user_documentation_plan.md not in README.md**

README.md lists only 10 documents, but we created #11 today.

**Fix:** Add to README.md index

---

## 🎨 GUI Design - Special Note

**08_gui_design.md is EXCEPTIONAL** (1,718 lines):
- Command Registry system fully specified
- 6 default toolbars defined
- Customization UI detailed
- 4 Perspectives specified
- 9 core panels cataloged
- 25+ gamification badges
- Keyboard shortcuts (80+ defined)
- Focus modes architecture

**This level of detail is RARE in pre-development!** 🌟

**Recommendation:** Use 08_gui_design.md as template for completing 03_architecture.md - same level of thoroughness.

---

## 🎯 Final Verdict

### Current Status: 🟡 **NEARLY READY** (70% complete)

**Can we start coding?**
- ✅ **YES - Weeks 1-4 of Phase 0** (CMake, wxWidgets, Python)
- ❌ **NO - Weeks 5+ of Phase 0** (Plugin Manager, Event Bus) without completing docs

**What's missing?**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL:** 03_architecture.md (3-5 days work)
- 🔴 **CRITICAL:** 04_plugin_system.md (4-6 days work)
- 🟡 **IMPORTANT:** 07_mvp_tasks.md (can do iteratively)
