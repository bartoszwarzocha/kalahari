## Vision

Create a complete **Writer's IDE** that allows authors to focus on creativity, eliminating technical and organizational barriers associated with writing books.

Kalahari is not just another word processor - it's a comprehensive environment designed specifically for **long-form writing** (novels, non-fiction books, historical works, journalism).

## What is Kalahari?

**Kalahari** is a native desktop application that combines:

- **Professional text editor** - Rich text editing with advanced formatting
- **Project management** - Organize chapters, sections, characters, locations
- **Research tools** - Manage sources, references, citations
- **AI assistant** - Personalized writing companion (8 African animals)
- **Analytics** - Track progress, pacing, productivity
- **Export tools** - Professional publishing formats (DOCX, PDF, EPUB)
- **Extensibility** - Python plugin system for unlimited customization

**Think:** Scrivener + VS Code + AI Assistant = Kalahari
