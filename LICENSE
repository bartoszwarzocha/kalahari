## Important Notes for Redistributors

### If you distribute Kalahari binaries:

1. **Include this LICENSE file** in your distribution.

2. **Include Qt dynamic libraries** (.dll on Windows, .so on Linux, .dylib on macOS).

3. **Inform users** they can replace Qt libraries with compatible versions (LGPL v3 requirement).

4. **Provide Qt source code** or a link to where users can obtain it:
   - Official Qt Downloads: https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/
   - Or include the exact Qt source used during build

5. **Do NOT statically link Qt** without purchasing a Commercial Qt License.
   - Static linking Qt with LGPL v3 is forbidden.
   - Dynamic linking (default in vcpkg) is required.

### If you modify Kalahari:

- You may distribute modified versions under any license (MIT is permissive).
- If you modify **Qt itself** (not Kalahari), you must release Qt modifications under LGPL v3.
- Modifications to Kalahari do NOT need to be open-sourced (MIT allows proprietary derivatives).
