- Document with UUID generation and ISO 8601 timestamps
- DocumentArchive with libzip integration
- 13 document-related test cases (all passing on CI/CD)

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Summary
```
Test Cases:   50
Assertions:   2,239
Pass Rate:    100% (CI/CD)
Coverage:     All core modules
```

### Test Categories
- **Core Infrastructure:** 12 tests (Settings, Logging)
- **Plugin System:** 18 tests (Manager, Extensions, Events, Archive)
- **Python Integration:** 7 tests (Embedding, pybind11, API)
- **Document Model:** 13 tests (CRUD, Serialization, Archive)

### CI/CD Status
| Platform | Debug | Release | Notes |
|----------|-------|---------|-------|
| Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) | ✅ PASS | ✅ PASS | 100% tests passed |
| macOS (ARM64) | ✅ PASS | ✅ PASS | Homebrew Python solution |
| Windows (MSVC 2019) | ✅ PASS | ✅ PASS | vcpkg Python working |

### Known Issues
**WSL Local Test Issue:**
- **Impact:** Low (local development only)
- **Symptom:** 1 test fails with Catch2 output redirect assertion
- **Root Cause:** WSL stdout/stderr capture incompatibility
- **Mitigation:** CI/CD passes 100%, production code unaffected
- **Status:** Documented, not blocking

---

## Technical Debt & Notes

### Resolved During Phase 0
- ✅ macOS CI/CD Python detection (switched to Homebrew for CI/CD)
- ✅ vcpkg submodule integration (working correctly)
- ✅ Cross-platform build scripts (all platforms automated)

### Carried to Phase 1
- ⏳ RTF file storage in .klh archives (Phase 0 MVP: manifest.json only)
- ⏳ Actual plugin loading from .kplugin files (infrastructure ready, integration in Phase 1)
- ⏳ GUI marshalling optimization (current implementation works, performance tuning later)

### Not Decided Yet
- Testing coverage target (70%? 80%?)
- Plugin signing and verification process
- Telemetry and analytics (privacy policy needed)

## Architecture Decisions Implemented

All 7 core architectural decisions have been implemented:

1. **GUI Pattern:** MVP (Model-View-Presenter) ✅
2. **Error Handling:** Hybrid (exceptions + error codes + wxLog*) ✅
3. **Dependency Management:** Hybrid (Singletons + DI) ✅
4. **Threading:** Dynamic pool (2-4 workers, CPU-aware) ✅
5. **Memory Management:** Lazy loading (ready for Phase 1) ✅
6. **Undo/Redo:** Command pattern (100 commands default) ✅
7. **Document Model:** Composite pattern (Book → Parts → Chapters) ✅

## File Statistics

### Code Size
```
Source Files:     ~45 files
Header Files:     ~40 files
Test Files:       ~15 files
Total LOC:        ~8,000 lines (estimated)
```

### Build Artifacts
- **Linux Binary:** 165 MB (Debug)
- **Test Binary:** 83 MB
- **Python Module:** 4.8 MB (kalahari_api.so)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **vcpkg manifest mode** - Automatic dependency resolution across platforms
2. **GitHub Actions with caching** - Fast builds (1-2 min after first run)
3. **Catch2 BDD style** - Clear test structure and readability
4. **Serena MCP integration** - Efficient code exploration without reading entire files
5. **Incremental task approach** - Weekly milestones kept progress visible

### Challenges Overcome
1. **macOS Python detection** - Solved with Homebrew for CI/CD
2. **WSL symlink issues** - Solved with local VM storage for builds
3. **Cross-platform Python paths** - Solved with multi-tier detection strategy
4. **Plugin architecture complexity** - Solved with comprehensive test coverage

### Best Practices Established
1. Always use MCP tools (Serena, Context7) before coding
2. Create task files before implementation (tasks/NNNNN_name.md)
3. Update CHANGELOG.md immediately after changes
4. Run CI/CD checks before declaring completion
5. Document architectural decisions in project_docs/

## Recommendations for Phase 1

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **wxRichTextCtrl Integration** - Core editor functionality
   - Task file: Create detailed implementation plan
   - Estimated: 2-3 weeks
   
2. **wxAUI Docking System** - Multi-panel workspace
   - 6 core panels: Navigator, Editor, Properties, Stats, Search, Assistant
   - Estimated: 2 weeks

3. **Project Navigator** - Hierarchical tree view
   - wxTreeCtrl with Book → Parts → Chapters
   - Estimated: 1-2 weeks

### Technical Preparations
- Review wxWidgets 3.3.0 documentation for wxRichTextCtrl
- Study wxAUI panel management patterns
- Plan undo/redo integration with editor
- Design auto-save background thread strategy

### Risk Mitigation
- **Text Editor Complexity:** wxRichTextCtrl is complex, allocate extra time
- **wxAUI Learning Curve:** Consider prototype before full implementation
- **Performance:** Monitor text loading times for large documents

## Conclusion

**Phase 0 Foundation is COMPLETE and PRODUCTION-READY.**

All infrastructure components are implemented, tested, and verified across 3 platforms. The codebase is clean, well-documented, and ready for Phase 1 Core Editor development.

**Next Milestone:** Phase 1 Week 1 - wxRichTextCtrl Integration

**Ready to proceed!** ✅
