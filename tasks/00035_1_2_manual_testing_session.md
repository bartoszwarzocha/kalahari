# Task #00035: Manual Testing Session - Command Registry System

**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Priority:** P1 (HIGH)
**Estimated:** 60-90 minutes
**Dependencies:** #00031 (MenuBuilder), #00032 (ToolbarBuilder), #00033 (Settings), #00034 (Documentation)
**Phase:** 1 (Core Editor)
**Zagadnienie:** 1.2 (Command Registry Architecture)
**Type:** Manual Testing

---

## Problem

Command Registry system is fully implemented and documented (Tasks #00031-#00034) but has not been manually tested end-to-end to verify:
- All menu items work correctly (execute commands)
- All toolbar buttons work correctly (execute commands)
- All keyboard shortcuts work correctly (execute commands)
- Enabled/disabled states update correctly based on application state
- Checked/unchecked states update correctly (Format menu toggles)
- Menu and toolbar state synchronization works
- Settings dialog opens via CommandRegistry
- All commands log execution properly

**Need:** Comprehensive manual testing session to verify the entire Command Registry system works as designed before moving to next zagadnienie.

---

## Solution

Conduct structured manual testing session covering:

1. **Menu Testing** - All menu items in File, Edit, Format menus
2. **Toolbar Testing** - All toolbar buttons
3. **Keyboard Shortcut Testing** - All registered shortcuts (Ctrl+N/O/S/Z/Y/X/C/V/B/I/U, etc.)
4. **State Management Testing** - Enable/disable logic, checked states
5. **Settings Integration Testing** - Settings command via menu/toolbar/keyboard
6. **Error Handling Testing** - Invalid command IDs, disabled commands
7. **Cross-UI Consistency Testing** - Same command works from menu/toolbar/keyboard

---

## Test Plan

### Preparation

**Prerequisites:**
- Build latest version (Task #00034 committed)
- Run from build directory: `./bin/kalahari`
- Have text document open OR no document (test both states)
- Have logging visible (check console output)

**Test environment:**
- Platform: Linux (WSL Ubuntu) - primary development environment
- Build type: Debug (verbose logging enabled)
- Configuration: Default settings.json

## Test Execution Guidelines

### Before Testing
1. Build latest version: `cmake --build build-linux-wsl -j4`
2. Verify build success: `ls bin/kalahari`
3. Start application with logging: `./bin/kalahari 2>&1 | tee test-session.log`
4. Have this task file open for checking off tests

### During Testing
- Check off each test as you complete it (⬜ → ✅ Pass or ❌ Fail)
- Note any unexpected behavior in "Issues Found" section below
- Take screenshots for critical issues
- Log all failures with reproduction steps

### After Testing
- Summarize results (X/Y tests passed)
- Create GitHub issues for any failures
- Update task file status based on results
- Commit test results to task file

---

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues (Block Release)
*None expected - log here if found*

### Major Issues (Should Fix Before Next Zagadnienie)
*None expected - log here if found*

### Minor Issues (Can Fix Later)
*None expected - log here if found*

### Enhancement Ideas (Future)
*Log any improvement ideas that come up during testing*

---

## Success Criteria

**Minimum passing threshold: 90% of tests pass**

For this task to be considered COMPLETE:
- [ ] All menu tests (File, Edit, Format) pass (15+ tests)
- [ ] All toolbar tests pass (8 tests)
- [ ] All keyboard shortcut tests pass (9 tests)
- [ ] State management tests pass (5 tests)
- [ ] Settings integration tests pass (4 tests)
- [ ] Cross-UI consistency tests pass (2 tests)
- [ ] Logging verification tests pass (3 tests)
- [ ] Critical issues: 0
- [ ] Major issues: ≤ 2
- [ ] Test results documented in this file

**If <90% pass:**
- Create separate bug fix tasks for failures
- Block next zagadnienie until fixes complete

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Task file created (this file)
- [ ] Testing session conducted (60-90 minutes)
- [ ] All test cases executed (checkboxes filled)
- [ ] Pass/Fail status recorded for each test
- [ ] Issues documented in "Issues Found" section
- [ ] Test summary generated (X/Y passed)
- [ ] GitHub issues created for any failures
- [ ] Task file committed with results

---

## Notes

### Why Manual Testing?
- Command Registry is core infrastructure used by all UI
- MenuBuilder/ToolbarBuilder are new code (not yet battle-tested)
- State management (isEnabled/isChecked) needs verification
- Better to catch issues now than after building more on top

### Test Environment Choice
- Primary: Linux (WSL Ubuntu) - main development platform
- Secondary: Windows (VS 2026) - if time permits after Linux tests
- macOS: Not tested (no macOS access)

### Automation Future
Many of these tests can be automated in Phase 2+:
- UI automation tests (CppTest, or Python + pyautogui)
- Unit tests for CommandRegistry (already exist - 16 tests, 100% pass)
- Integration tests for MenuBuilder/ToolbarBuilder
