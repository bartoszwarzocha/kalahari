# Archived Task Files - Old Plan (2025-11-11)

**Reason for Archive:** These task files were created prematurely (before Task #00030 completion) and represent an old architectural plan that was redesigned on 2025-11-12.

**Old Plan (these files):**
- #00031: ToolbarManager Singleton
- #00032: Toolbar Persistence
- #00033: Project Toolbar Config
- #00034: Edit Toolbar Config
- #00035: MainWindow Full Integration

**Current Plan (ROADMAP 2025-11-12):**
- #00031: Dynamic Menu Builder
- #00032: Dynamic Toolbar Builder
- #00033: Add Settings Menu Commands
- #00034: Verify Command State Management
- #00035: Document Command Registry Architecture

**Note:** ToolbarManager concept from old #00031 may be revisited in future tasks as an advanced feature after basic ToolbarBuilder is implemented.
