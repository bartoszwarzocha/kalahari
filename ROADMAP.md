## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Cross-platform issues:** Continuous CI/CD testing, regular platform smoke tests
- **Plugin stability:** Sandboxing, version compatibility checks, plugin review process
- **Performance:** Profiling from Phase 1, optimization sprints, lazy loading
- **wxWidgets limitations:** Early prototyping, fallback plans, community support

### Business Risks
- **Low conversion:** Focus on exceptional free tier, gradual premium upsell
- **Competition:** Differentiate with unique features (Command Registry, customization)
- **Market fit:** Beta testing with real writers, community feedback loops
- **Sustainability:** Diversified revenue (plugins + cloud), open source community

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope creep:** Strict phase boundaries, MVP focus, defer nice-to-haves
- **Platform parity:** Automated testing, dedicated platform QA weeks
- **Plugin complexity:** Start simple (Phase 2), iterate based on feedback
- **Documentation lag:** Document parallel with implementation, dedicated docs phase
