**Goal:** Build technical infrastructure and plugin architecture foundation

**Status:** ✅ Week 6-8 COMPLETE (.kplugin Handler + Document Model Complete)
**Target Version:** 0.1.0-alpha
**Timeline:** 2-3 months from project start
**Started:** 2025-10-26
**Week 2 Completed:** 2025-10-26 (GUI, Threading, Logging)
**Week 3 Completed:** 2025-10-27 (Settings System, Build Scripts)
**Week 3-4 Completed:** 2025-10-29 (Plugin Manager + pybind11 + Compilation Fixes)

**Week 6 Completed:** 2025-10-30 (.kplugin Format Handler + Actual Plugin Loading)
**Week 8 Completed:** 2025-10-30 (Document Model + JSON Serialization)

### Architectural Decisions ✅ FINALIZED (2025-10-25)
- ✅ **GUI Pattern:** MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
  - Clear separation: Model (data) ↔ Presenter (logic) ↔ View (GUI)
  - Testable business logic (Presenters can be unit tested)
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Hybrid approach
  - Exceptions for programmer errors (invalid_argument, logic_error)
  - Error codes (std::optional) for expected failures
  - wxLog* for user-facing messages
- ✅ **Dependency Management:** Hybrid approach
  - Singletons for infrastructure (EventBus, CommandRegistry, PluginManager)
  - Dependency Injection for business logic (Models, Presenters)
- ✅ **Threading:** Dynamic thread pool
  - 2-4 worker threads (CPU-aware, adjustable ±2)
  - Python GIL handling (py::gil_scoped_acquire/release)
  - GUI marshalling (wxTheApp->CallAfter)
- ✅ **Memory Management:** Lazy loading (from Phase 1)
  - Metadata eager (titles, structure, stats)
  - Content on-demand (chapter text loaded when opened)
  - Smart pointers everywhere
- ✅ **Undo/Redo:** Command pattern
  - 100 commands default (configurable)
  - Mergeable consecutive edits
- ✅ **Document Model:** Composite pattern
  - Book → Parts → Chapters (flexible nested structure)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Cross-platform issues:** Continuous CI/CD testing, regular platform smoke tests
- **Plugin stability:** Sandboxing, version compatibility checks, plugin review process
- **Performance:** Profiling from Phase 1, optimization sprints, lazy loading
- **wxWidgets limitations:** Early prototyping, fallback plans, community support

### Business Risks
- **Low conversion:** Focus on exceptional free tier, gradual premium upsell
- **Competition:** Differentiate with unique features (Command Registry, customization)
- **Market fit:** Beta testing with real writers, community feedback loops
- **Sustainability:** Diversified revenue (plugins + cloud), open source community

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope creep:** Strict phase boundaries, MVP focus, defer nice-to-haves
- **Platform parity:** Automated testing, dedicated platform QA weeks
- **Plugin complexity:** Start simple (Phase 2), iterate based on feedback
- **Documentation lag:** Document parallel with implementation, dedicated docs phase

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- **vcpkg:** Package manager (official, Microsoft-backed)
- **Python 3.11:** Plugin runtime (stable, 5+ years support)
- **pybind11:** C++/Python binding (active development, proven in production)

### Internal Dependencies
- **Phase 0 → Phase 1:** Plugin system must be functional before plugins
- **Phase 1 → Phase 2:** Core editor needed for plugin testing
- **Phase 2 → Phase 3:** Plugin API stability required for premium plugins
- **Phase 4 → Phase 5:** All features complete before polish/testing

### Community Dependencies
- **Beta testers:** Recruit during Phase 3-4, active in Phase 5
